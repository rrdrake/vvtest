Release 1.0
-----------

Aug 26, 2018

Improvements:

    - Add "insert directive file" keyword to test file preprocessing.  This
      allows test header specifications to include and share specifications
      from other files.

    - Port to python 3.  All python versions greater or equal to 2.5 should
      work.

    - Add --run-dir <directory> option.  This overrides the default naming
      scheme of the "TestResults.<platform>.ON=.OFF=" pattern.

    - Add additional test script utilties, such as simple_aprepro.

    - Add --test-args <arguments> option.  This passes arbitrary arguments
      into each test script at runtime.

    - Add arbitrary test dependencies.  A test can now depend on another test.
      The test will not run until the dependency is run, and the directory of
      the dependency test is made available so its output can be processed.
      The test directive keyword is "depends on".

Fixes:

    - Allow recursive vvtest invocations.  Tests being run in vvtest can now
      invoke vvtest.
